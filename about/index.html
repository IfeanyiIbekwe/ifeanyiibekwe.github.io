    <p>
        Blending dynamic eCommerce expertise with web development acumen, I've been at the forefront of digital transformations in the luxury hospitality sector. My tenure at <a href="https://www.fivehotelsandresorts.com/" target="_blank">FIVE Hotels and Resorts</a> stands as a testament, where I orchestrated performance marketing campaigns that culminated in an impressive 60% in direct bookings.
    </p>

    <h3>Role at FIVE:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Digital Oversight: Steered the digital presence for the brand across two strategic locations: Dubai and Zurich, ensuring a unified brand voice and superior user experience.</li>
        <li>F&B Digital Marketing Leadership: Commandeered the digital marketing initiatives for FIVE's distinguished F&B establishments, such as <a href="#SoulStreetURL" target="_blank">Soul Street</a>, <a href="#ThePenthouseURL" target="_blank">The Penthouse</a>, and <a href="#CinqueURL" target="_blank">Cinque</a>, driving robust online bookings and walk-ins.</li>
        <li>Training & Capacity Building: Championed the training and development of colleagues, nurturing a digitally savvy team.</li>
        <li>Analytics & Reporting: Oversaw all digital marketing reports, transforming analytics into actionable strategies.</li>
        <li>Cost Management: Consistently achieved a commendable cost per cover of AED 5 or less, highlighting the ROI-driven nature of the campaigns.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        My technological repertoire is expansive, spanning platforms like Umbraco, WordPress, Google Analytics, Shopify, and not to forget, Facebook Ads. My hands-on skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript further amplify my digital proficiency. I'm also certified in both Google Analytics and Google Adwords.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to my corporate achievements, I proudly co-founded BOPF. Under my stewardship, the brand skyrocketed to a revenue of 1.5 M AED annually, all achieved on a lean digital budget of AED 60K. I was instrumental in building the site from scratch, spearheading negotiations with pivotal vendors, including BNPL partners and Stripe.
    </p>

    <p>
        While my roots trace back to Nigeria, I now make an impact in Dubai alongside my family. Beyond the confines of professional roles, my passion lies in empowering SMEs and large corporations to achieve unparalleled success and ROI through meticulously crafted digital marketing strategies.
