                    Every journey begins with a spark. For me, that spark was ignited over a decade ago when I first set foot in Dubai—a city that has shaped both my personal and professional journey. It’s here that I’ve blended my passions for digital strategy, fashion, and building high-performing teams.
                    <br><br>
                    My career took flight at <strong>FIVE Hotels and Resorts</strong>, where I drove digital strategies that went beyond just increasing bookings—they created unforgettable guest experiences. A standout campaign resulted in a 35% surge in direct bookings during peak seasons. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was while leading growth at FIVE that I took a leap of faith and co-founded <a href="http://thebopf.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Business of Preloved Fashion (BOPF)</em></a> in 2021. In just a few years, BOPF has generated over 5M AED in revenue, proving that sustainable fashion can thrive in a luxury market.
                    <br><br>
                    The journey continued at <strong>Madinat Jumeirah Resort</strong>, where I spearheaded digital initiatives that brought new concepts like <strong>Cala Vista</strong> to life, driving a 20% increase in reservations. Each project was an opportunity to reimagine how digital marketing can connect with people on a deeper level.
                    <br><br>
                    Beyond metrics and campaigns, my commitment to family and fostering cohesive teams has always been my anchor. Whether nurturing close relationships or leading teams that operate like families, I believe in building units that thrive together.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>As I continue this journey,</strong> I’m driven by a desire to inspire, connect, and create meaningful impact. If you’re looking for someone who can blend strategy with storytelling to achieve real results, let’s connect and build the next chapter together.
