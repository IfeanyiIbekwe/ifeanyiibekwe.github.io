    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        Digital marketing leader with a strong focus on the luxury hospitality and F&B sectors, bringing a proven track record of crafting transformative strategies that drive brand growth and revenue. Currently, I lead digital marketing for all F&B businesses across Madinat Jumeirah Resort, strategically positioning dining venues at Jumeirah Al Qasr, Mina A'Salam, and Al Naseem. Over the past year, my data-driven campaigns have achieved a 20% increase in reservations, set new benchmarks for customer retention, and driven exceptional ROI.
    </p>
    <p>
        Among my key accomplishments, I successfully launched the opening campaign for <strong>Cala Vista</strong> at Mina A’Salam, creating a multi-funnel digital approach that exceeded reservation targets. At <strong>FIVE Hotels and Resorts</strong>, I developed and executed the launch for <strong>Soul Street</strong>, establishing it as a vibrant culinary destination. Recently, I led the “<strong>Balloons at the Palace</strong>” tactical campaign, a special activation at Jumeirah Al Qasr, which captured guest engagement through an immersive guest journey and unique culinary offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, I co-founded <em>The Business of Preloved Fashion</em> (BOPF), a luxury resale platform with a mission to democratize high-end fashion. Since its inception, BOPF has generated 5M AED in revenue, underscoring my ability to drive growth across both corporate and entrepreneurial environments.
